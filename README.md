This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to the insecure use of innerHTML. The bug.html file shows the problematic code that attempts to inject script tags using innerHTML. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if malicious scripts are injected. The solution.html file provides a corrected version using DOM manipulation methods to avoid these risks.  Always sanitize user input and prefer DOM manipulation over innerHTML for safer and more predictable behavior.
